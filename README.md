# HOW TO RUN

**Note: The below setup is very convoluted as this was done as a proof of concept, but capturing this for auditability**

### Setting up AWS toolkit locally

Steps:
1. Clone [aws-toolkit-vscode](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode) from Github
2. [TEMPORARY] Change to commit `819e63` as this has the `generateClients` script that is needed
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run generateClients`
5. Modify `featureDev.ts` to log on console the bearer token used (for local runs only, do NOT store this)
6. Run the VS code extension and trigger the codewhisperer client by starting Amazon Q chat
7. Retrieve bearer token from developer tools console

### Setting up Cat-GPT
1. Edit `callCodeWhispererClient()` in `basepettype.ts` to use the bearer token retrieved above
2. Copy the codewhisperer client to this package via `cp -r <PATH_TO_TOOLKIT>/aws-toolkit-vscode/src.gen/@amzn ./node_modules/`
3. Run `npm install <PATH_TO_TOOLKIT>/aws-toolkit-vscode/src.gen/@amzn/codewhisperer-streaming --save --no-audit`
4. Run `npm run compile`
5. Run the VS code extension and open developer tools console
6. Try hovering over the pets - this should call codewhisperer streaming client and have them say something!
